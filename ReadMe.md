    ## Repository Description
    ###### [Back to Table of Contents](#Table-of-Contents)
As I am progressing in my journey of becoming a full-stack web developer ([certified](https://bootcamp.uw.edu/coding/landing/?psna=3&psnac=3&s=Google-Brand&msg_cv_scta=4&msg_cv_stbn=1&msg_cv_fcta=1&fqvar1=3&pkw=uw%20coding%20bootcamp&pcrid=463279349731&pmt=e&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=GGL%7CUNIVERSITY-OF-WASHINGTON%7CSEM%7CCODING%7C-%7COFL%7CTIER-1%7CALL%7CBRD%7CEXACT%7CCore%7CBootcamp&utm_term=uw%20coding%20bootcamp&s=google&k=uw%20coding%20bootcamp&utm_adgroupid=112635573270&utm_locationphysicalms=9033421&utm_matchtype=e&utm_network=g&utm_device=c&utm_content=463279349731&utm_placement=&gclid=EAIaIQobChMI-bvnhMug7gIV2iCtBh0LcQHMEAAYASAAEgIAwfD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds)), I have experiences being asked to complete a coding assessment; or even being asscessed.  Having a code quiz, to assess yourself, periodically, even regularly, can be th difference in landing a dream career.  However, I also noticed through various parts of the interview process (personal, and as an observer), personality goes a long way.   I always believe there is room to grow in everything.  I decided to make a challenging, and personal assesment of my own.  A typical coding assessment is a combination of multiple-choice questions and interactive coding challenges; but where's the fun in that, right?!  So I develop an application that any developer should be able to get the answers correct; and for those who may interview me, but do not have a clue for coding...theres a little something for them, too ;-)

I honestly believe I tested myself, as I tried to build this application, with a timer, questions (multiple-choice, true or false, fill-in-the-blank), made it feature a dynamic, yet updated HTML; which is powered both, by CSS, and JavaScript code. I desired to give it clean, polished, and responsive user interface; and not let it get boring. This application has a code on many levels: as an administrator giving this application, my peers testing their knowledge of me; and a developer or anyone seeking cognate and attuitive skill development.

Remember this also, as a developer, your goal should be designing NEW experiences that makes people's lives simple; because as developers, we solve problems that people didn't even knew they had- even better, in a way that they do not understand: We are the super heroes and heriones of tomorrow; so get coding, and I hope this repository helps you along your development. - [Frederick Thomas](https://www.linkedin.com/in/discoverfrederickthomas/), Super Coding Ninja™

## User Story
### As the Quiz Administrator
###### [Back to Table of Contents](#Table-of-Contents)
    1.   I want to see if the developer recognizes simple code.
    2.   I want to see if the developer understands how to apply code and logic.
    3.   I want to see if someone, like a mathematician or other science major, is attuitive enough to develop themselves as a developer.
    4.   I want to see how each party handles pressure of deadlines; especially when they may not know the answer, yet (we can all lear, if we're willing to stick it out, "Stick-to-it-ness!").
    5.   I want to know how quickly a person can assess challenging situations, with unexpected outcomes (I told you ;-) ).
    6.   I want to see if an individual is a "settler," or a person who can pick themselves up from failure; and make it into their success!
    7.   I want to see a ranking order of all examinees, with their scores + time left.

### As a Developer:
###### [Back to Table of Contents](#Table-of-Contents)
    1.   I want to ensure I use proper semantics; and simplify my CSS file.
    2.   I want to ensure my sections are properly indented.
    3.   I want to ensure the applications are responsive to most viewports/devices.
    4.   I want the resources not to hinder the site's load time.
    5.   I want to see if I can recognize new approaches; or try an approach of my own.

### As the Examinee:
###### [Back to Table of Contents](#Table-of-Contents)
    1.   I want to test my cognate and attuitive skills, for development; and potential career(s).
    2.   I want to see how quickly I can assess any given situation, with unexpected outcomes.
    3.   I want to become a better developer (Student, Junior Developer, Senior Developer- all can be better).

    
## Overview: What We Accomplished!
### Workflow [Back to Table of Contents](#Table-of-Contents)
    1. Made a powerful [application](https://supercodingninja.github.io/CodeQuiz/), by CSS3 and Javascript (mostly, without frameworks, concerning functionality: I need to make it more friendly for mobile devices).
    2. The application works, save for submitting scores: I need to identify a better logic approach (no syntax errors, save for an occassionl pause in my debugger- event listeners, perhaps).
    3. "Stick-to-it-ness!"  I never gave up, I JUST GOT BETTER!
    4. Increase my professional and personal network, through peer code reviews.
    5. Increase motivation, dedication; and dicovered new inspiration!
    6. Increase my cognate and attuitive skills, through many trials and errors.
    7. I learn to "implement my logic; and then test it, immediately: don't write code out like an essay, and then try to proof read (not pratical, and often does not work).

## Repositiory End-Goal Criterea
###### [Back to Table of Contents](#Table-of-Contents)
Given that we met our Users' Stories, we want to accomplish the following criterea ([see demo](docs/Demo/cssDemo.gif)):

    1. I want to discover, implement, and test new logic approaches (find out what works best, for me, and my clients).
    2. Make this application completely functional.
    3. NEVER quit!!!
